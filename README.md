## About
This repository contains a simple Python package for a moist energy balance model (`mebm`).
The model is used in Peterson and Boos (2020) to analyze feedbacks and eddy diffusivity in the context of tropical rainfall shifts.
Features include
- Easily customizable initial conditions, albedo, insolation, and outgoing longwave radiation schemes
- Efficient and scalable multigrid numerical scheme
- Ability to perturb insolation (as in Clark et al. 2018) and analyze energy flux equator (EFE) shifts.
